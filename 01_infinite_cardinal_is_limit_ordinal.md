# Statement

Infinite cardinal number is a limit number.

# Contrapositive

If a is not a limit ordinal, then a is not an infinite cardinal number

# Proof

Recall limit numbers are ordinal numbers with no immediate predecessor: if a and b are ordinal number, a is a limit number and b < a, then there exists a c such that b < c < a.

Recall a cardinal number a is an ordinal number such that if b is an ordinal number equivalent to a, then a <= b (for all b's equivalent to a).

Suppose a is an infinite ordinal number that is not a limit number. Let us define b as the immediate predecessor of a, also define b as infinite. Then b < a. Since b is a subset of a and b is infinite, then a and b are equivalent. Therefore, a cannot be a cardinal number, as b < a. This assertion will be true until a has no predecessor. 

Since an ordinal with no immediate predecessors are limit numbers, it must be that inifinite cardinals are limit numbers.
